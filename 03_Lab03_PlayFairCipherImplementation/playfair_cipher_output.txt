=== Introduction to Playfair Cipher ===

The Playfair Cipher is a manual symmetric encryption technique and is one of the
first digraph substitution ciphers. The encryption process uses a 5x5 matrix
of letters constructed using a keyword. The letters are combined in pairs, and
different rules apply based on their position in the matrix.

=== Rules for Playfair Cipher ===

1. **Creating the Key Matrix**:
- Choose a keyword (e.g., "PLAYFAIR") and remove any duplicate letters.
- Replace the letter 'J' with 'I' (e.g., "JACK" becomes "IACK").
- Fill a 5x5 matrix with the letters of the keyword first, followed by the remaining letters of the alphabet (excluding 'J').

2. **Preparing the Plaintext**:
- Convert all letters to uppercase and remove non-alphabet characters.
- If a pair of letters in plaintext is identical (e.g., "LL"), insert an 'X' between them (e.g., "LL" becomes "LX").
- If the plaintext has an odd number of characters, append an 'X' at the end (e.g., "HELLO" becomes "HELX LO").

3. **Encrypting the Plaintext**:
- Divide the formatted plaintext into pairs of letters.
- For each pair, apply the following rules:
a. **Same Row**: If both letters are in the same row of the matrix, replace them with the letters immediately to their right (wrap around to the beginning of the row if needed).
b. **Same Column**: If both letters are in the same column, replace them with the letters immediately below (wrap around to the top if needed).
c. **Rectangle**: If the letters form a rectangle in the matrix, replace them with the letters on the same row but at the opposite corners of the rectangle.

4. **Decrypting the Ciphertext**:
- Follow the same process as encryption but reverse the rules:
a. For letters in the same row, replace them with the letters immediately to their left.
b. For letters in the same column, replace them with the letters immediately above.
c. For letters forming a rectangle, swap them as before.

Let's explore how this works with the key 'PLAYF':
