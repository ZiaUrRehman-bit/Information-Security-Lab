=== Introduction to Caesar Cipher ===

The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.
It is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted'
by a certain number of positions down the alphabet.

The mathematical formula for encryption is:
E(x) = (x + n) % 26

Where:
- E(x) is the encrypted letter.
- x is the position of the letter in the alphabet (starting from 0 for 'A').
- n is the shift value (the number of positions to shift).

The decryption formula is:
D(x) = (x - n) % 26

Let's explore how this works with an example using a shift value of 3.


=== Caesar Cipher Encryption ===

Encrypting H:
  - Current Position (Index of H): 7
  - Shift by 3: (7 + 3) % 26 = 10
  - Encrypted Character: H → K
Encrypting E:
  - Current Position (Index of E): 4
  - Shift by 3: (4 + 3) % 26 = 7
  - Encrypted Character: E → H
Encrypting L:
  - Current Position (Index of L): 11
  - Shift by 3: (11 + 3) % 26 = 14
  - Encrypted Character: L → O
Encrypting L:
  - Current Position (Index of L): 11
  - Shift by 3: (11 + 3) % 26 = 14
  - Encrypted Character: L → O
Encrypting O:
  - Current Position (Index of O): 14
  - Shift by 3: (14 + 3) % 26 = 17
  - Encrypted Character: O → R

=== Caesar Cipher Decryption ===

Decrypting K:
  - Current Position (Index of K): 10
  - Shift by 3: (10 - 3) % 26 = 7
  - Decrypted Character: K → H
Decrypting H:
  - Current Position (Index of H): 7
  - Shift by 3: (7 - 3) % 26 = 4
  - Decrypted Character: H → E
Decrypting O:
  - Current Position (Index of O): 14
  - Shift by 3: (14 - 3) % 26 = 11
  - Decrypted Character: O → L
Decrypting O:
  - Current Position (Index of O): 14
  - Shift by 3: (14 - 3) % 26 = 11
  - Decrypted Character: O → L
Decrypting R:
  - Current Position (Index of R): 17
  - Shift by 3: (17 - 3) % 26 = 14
  - Decrypted Character: R → O

Final Decrypted Text: HELLO
